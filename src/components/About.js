            <p>My name is Kristina Kapitanova and I am currently in my second year towards my BSc Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence degree at Loughborough University, United Kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>Although I gained interest in programming fairly recently, I consider myself a fast and determined learner, which helped me gain a quick pace in my ongoing journey towards becoming a great developer.   
            </p>
            <p>I used to be one of the best tennis players in the country, which has helped me gain exceptional time management skills, has consistenly tested my willpower and helped me grow. 
            </p> 
            <p> Being a well-rounded person is key to personal growth, which is why I am thankful for all the years spent training tennis professionally.</p>
